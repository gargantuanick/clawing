As Labradors age, their joints require specialized support that standard fiber-fill beds simply cannot provide. A 70lb+ senior Lab needs high-density, medical-grade orthopedic foam to prevent pressure points and manage conditions like hip dysplasia or arthritis.

## 1. Big Barker 7" Orthopedic Dog Bed — Overall Best
![Big Barker Dog Bed](/images/big-barker.jpg)

The Big Barker is the gold standard for large breeds. Unlike most "orthopedic" beds that flatten under weight, this bed is calibrated specifically for large dogs.

- **What we like:** 10-year "won't flatten" guarantee. 
- **What we don't like:** Premium price point.
- **Who it's for:** Owners who want a "buy it once" solution for a heavy senior Lab.

## 2. PetFusion Ultimate Dog Bed — Best Value

Featuring 4 inches of solid memory foam, the PetFusion provides a great balance of comfort and support without the Big Barker's price tag.

- **What we like:** Water-resistant liner and breathable cover.
- **What we don't like:** Bolsters can take up sleeping surface area.
- **Who it's for:** Labs that like to rest their heads on a pillow (bolster) while sleeping.
